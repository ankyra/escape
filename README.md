# Escape 

![Escape Logo](/hero.png)

Escape is an Open Source release engineering toolkit that can be used to build,
test, version, deploy and operate software across layers, environments and
clouds.

Some things you can do with Escape:

* Create repeatable builds with predictable versioning, packaging and distribution 
* Use the same delivery process for different tools and layers: deploy your
  infrastructure and container code like you deploy your application code.
* Manage multiple environments: promote from Dev to Prod.
* Composition: break your application up into logical components and compose them
  into a cohesive platform.
* Simplify configuration management; programmatically define and wire up a
  component's inputs and outputs.
* Operate running deployments
* Create self-documenting environments and releases

This repository contains the official Escape client. The Escape Inventory can
be found [here](https://github.com/ankyra/escape-inventory).
